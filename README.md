Here, I post Togenyan's Yo-kai-watch Save Editors (Finally completed!!!!!!)

# Tutorial :

you need a hacked 3ds with custom frimware
you need the JKSM Editor (https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases)
install the cia
Export your save file and transfer it to your computer
open the editor on your computer
edit your savefile
then save the edited safe file
and put it where you imported your safe file
put your sd back in your 3ds
launch the JKSM Editor 
Import your save file
launch yokai watch
your save should be edited!

# MAKING A WRONG CHANGE COULD CORRUPT YOUR SAVEFILE, DO NOT BLAME TOGENYAN OR ANYONE INVLOVED IN THE EDITOR!
